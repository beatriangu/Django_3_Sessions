# Django_3_Sessions

ex00 This exercise focuses on managing anonymous user sessions in Django by using sessions, middleware, and templates to handle temporarily assigned random names. Implementing sessions to store the name, middleware to manage its validity period, and templates to display the name fulfills the requirement of maintaining name persistence for 42 seconds and ensuring it appears instantly on the website.
ex01 the next step is to add user management by creating an authentication interface.Use of django_bootstrap5 in my case.

ex02 Creating a Tip Mode,score it,list it. Contro of the  ModelForm used.

ex03 With the Tip system now functional, the next step is to add a voting and management control system.

ex04 This exercise focuses on enforcing authorization rules and ensuring that only permitted actions are allowed, with an exception for Tip authors.

ex05  Implementing fine-grained control over downvoting by using custom permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform this action.

ex06 By implementing a reputation-based system, users earn and lose permissions based on their activity and interaction with Tips, automating and refining user privileges based on their contributions and feedback received.
