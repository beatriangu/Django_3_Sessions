# Django_3_Sessions
The exercise involves creating a website project where users can post "Life Pro Tips." You need to implement an anonymous session system where users are assigned a random name from a list of 10 names for 42 seconds. This name should be persistent and displayed in a <nav> element on the homepage as "Hello user!" until the validity period ends. After 42 seconds, the name should change to a new random one. The name must be instantly visible across all pages without requiring a page reload.
